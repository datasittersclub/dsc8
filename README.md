It's a really big file, and may not load in the GitHub preview. But if you download this repo and launch it using Jupyter Notebook, you should be able to read it. (New to Jupyter notebooks? [Check out this tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks).)

If you'd like to explore the data from this book, you can check out the [data folder](data), which has CSV files for all the distance calculations in the book, along with the tf-idf (most distinctive words) values for the books, and the chapter 2 6-gram values. The [viz folder](viz) has high-resolution version of all the visualizations.
